Democrats win the House, as most people would probably expect. 

What's hard to predict about the Senate is that whether the Democrats win or not will depend heavily on voter turnout. This has become unpredictable throughout the primary season--nobody expected, for example, Andrew Gillum's win for governor in Florida or Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez's upset in New York, let alone Doug Jones' Democratic win in Alabama last year. Given these facts, it would be fun to assume that Democratic turnout tomorrow will be unprecedented since the '70s; this would mean upsets in races like Texas' Senate race (Beto/Cruz), which takes place in a state where the Republican share of the vote in 2016 showed a relative decline. Whether or not this means that senators like McCaskill, who are in seats that have turned more red overtime, will win is still rough to determine. (For context: 2012 Texas went for Romney 57%; Trump in Texas was 52%. In Missouri, 2012 Romney = 53%; 2016 Trump = 57%.)
